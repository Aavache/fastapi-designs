## Asynchronous Operations

Experience the power of asynchronous programming in FastAPI. Learn how to handle long-running tasks without blocking your API using the `async` and `await` syntax. Discover the benefits of improved responsiveness and scalability while maintaining efficient request handling.

## Content Negotiation

Explore content negotiation and its role in allowing clients to request specific data formats, such as JSON or XML. Learn how to use the `Accept` header to facilitate flexible data exchange while ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Deprecation Strategy

Master the art of deprecating old API versions gracefully. Dive into versioning, clear deprecation warnings, and a well-defined migration strategy. Understand the importance of effective communication to guide users through transitions and keep your API ecosystem up-to-date.

## Idempotence

Uncover the significance of designing idempotent APIs. Explore how to ensure that repeated requests have the same effect as making them once. Learn about the reliability, scalability, and predictability benefits that idempotence brings to your API architecture.

## Statelessness

Discover the elegance of stateless API design. Embrace the principles of simplicity, scalability, and reliability by building APIs that don't rely on server-side state or context. Learn how this approach improves caching, load balancing, and redundancy in your API ecosystem.

## Get Started

Each example is contained in its own directory with detailed explanations and code snippets. To get started, simply navigate to the example you're interested in and follow the README instructions. You'll find clear steps, sample code, and explanations to guide you through the process.
